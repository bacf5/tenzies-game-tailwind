## How to play

You start with 10 dice. The object of the game is to roll the dice as fast as possible, the player who gets all dice on the same number wins!

## Built

Is built with React and TailwindCSS.

## Concepts that I practice in this small project

- Custom Components
- Static Pages
- Props
- Mapping data
- Event Listener
- Conditional Rendering
- [useSound](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-sound) custom hook

## Future ideas

- ~~Add sounds effects~~ ✔️
- Track time it took to win
- Use localStorage to save best time / roll number
- Track numbers of rolls
